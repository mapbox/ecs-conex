## Working with GitHub repositories requiring private npm modules

In order to require private npm modules, you will need to export an npm access token environmental variable in the ecs-conex build, and write that access token to an `.npmrc` file in your GitHub repository's Dockerfile.

1. Your ecs-conex CloudFormation stack was provided with an npm access token in the parameter `NPMAccessToken`. This exposes your token to the GitHub repository you are watching.
2. In your GitHub repository's Dockerfile, specify that you'd like to pass the npm access token at build-time, write this token to `.npmrc` prior to dependency installation:

```
# Environmental vars
ARG NPMAccessToken

# Create .npmrc
RUN echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=$NPMAccessToken" > ./.npmrc
ONBUILD COPY .npmrc ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Clean up
RUN rm -f ./.npmrc
```
